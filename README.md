Learning how
I want to use the data from this public website to create a new app https://adeaels.arkansas.gov/AelsWeb/Search.aspx
The database is old and there is no API for it.
I want to create a bot to gather all the data for me so I can use it for the app.
The data needs to be in a spreadsheet format.
I need help learning how to do this.
